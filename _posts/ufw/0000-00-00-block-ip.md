```bash
# Deny completely
$ sudo ufw deny from A.B.C.D/M to any

# Reject
$ sudo ufw reject from 202.54.5.7 to any
```

_You use reject when you want the other end (attacker) to know the port or IP is unreachable. However, we use deny for connections to attackers (hosts) you donâ€™t want people to see at all. In other words the reject sends a reject response to the source, while the deny (DROP) target sends nothing at all._
